# YOLO-Object-Detection
Welcome to my repository on YOLO object detection! This repository is based on my blog post about YOLO and its applications in object detection. You can find my blog post [here](https://jrprasanna.com/2023/01/15/object-detection-using-yolo-in-python-a-beginners-guide/)

In this repository, you will find the following:

  1. Code for implementing YOLO object detection using the OpenCV library in Python
  2. Sample images and videos for testing the code
  3. A detailed explanation of the code and the YOLO algorithm in the form of comments in the code
  4. A link to my blog post for further reading and understanding

To run the code, you will need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. You will also need to download the pre-trained weights file for YOLO from the official website and place it in the same directory as the code file.

Please note that the code and the explanations provided are for educational purposes only and are not meant for commercial use.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me via my blog or mail me at prassijr@gmail.com.

Thank you for visiting my repository and I hope you find the information and resources provided useful.
